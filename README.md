# 🚗 Car Brand EDA & Business Insights

This project explores a car price dataset using Python. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover patterns and answer key business questions that can guide decisions in the automotive industry.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used: `car_price_dataset.csv`  
It contains features like:

- `Brand`
- `Model`
- `Year`
- `Transmission`
- `Fuel Type`
- `Engine Size`
- `Mileage`
- `Price`

---

## 📊 Objectives

1. Perform detailed EDA on car features and pricing.
2. Analyze trends by brand, year, fuel type, and engine size.
3. Answer relevant **business questions**, such as:
   - Which car brands offer the best resale value?
   - How does mileage affect car price?
   - Are automatic cars priced higher than manual ones?
   - Does fuel type significantly influence price?
   - Which brands depreciate the fastest over time?

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Brand Value**: Brands like BMW and Audi tend to retain value better compared to others.
- **Mileage Impact**: Price generally decreases with increasing mileage, but some luxury brands show slower depreciation.
- **Transmission**: Automatic cars are priced higher on average.
- **Fuel Type**: Diesel cars command slightly higher prices in older models, while petrol dominates in newer ones.
- **Year-wise Trends**: Newer models have a steep price curve; older models show a plateau or drop.
